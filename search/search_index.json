Open World \u00b6 For any given \"Thing\"\u2014i.e. an object\u2014there may be many representations in many datasets. An object's representations may be different in shape, meaning, timeliness, relevance and quality\u2014i.e. any given representation of information about a given object may represent a different version of the truth. All representations of any given object shall be linked via shared identifiers. Identifiers shall be meaningless, opaque, web-resolvable and universally unique. See principle 1. An object can have multiple identifiers. Any given object consists of 1 or more datapoints. A datapoint represents a logical property of a given object. \\begin{itemize} The identifier for a datapoint is the identifier of the object it belongs to plus at least one identifier of the axiom that describes its meaning (which is also an object). Datapoints} for the same object can exist in many datasets. with potentially multiple versions of the truth in terms of meaning, timeliness, relevance and quality. Any representation for any given datapoint of any data source shall be made available to any device, node or edge in the network within legal, policy and entitlement limits in real-time. Every \"object\" that is represented as data in whichever dataset anywhere, shall have an identifier that is universally unique, permanent, meaningless or opaque and therefore shareable, resolvable through the HTTP protocol.

The word \u201cdata\u201d has a lot of different notions associated with it. We have these statements above, like \u201call data is connected\u201d, \u201c\u2026data will be made available anywhere\u2026\u201d, which could reinforce a particular notion that data is something that \u201cexists\u201d all around us, like a digital footprint of activities. On top of these statements on \u201cdata\u201d, the EKG is introduced as a combination of one or more data markets, which could further reinforce that \"EKG is connected data\". If that\u2019s the notion that the manifesto wants to declare, it may appeal strongly to some sections more than others, like those dealing with consolidation, analysis, reporting, verification etc. If the manifesto\u2019s intent is broader (here, I am very conscious of Carl\u2019s note that it should stay away from any hubris!) it would help if there is a way to declare that information and knowledge is also data. And it is when we combine the digital footprint of activities along with a digital representation of information and knowledge, that a Knowledge Graph emerges. And on top of that notion, an Enterprise Knowledge Graph is connections of Knowledge Graphs across an Enterprise.
