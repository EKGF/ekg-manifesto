Much higher levels of [transparency](vocab/transparency), [openness](vocab/openness.md),\n   [sustainability](vocab/sustainability.md), [fairness](vocab/fairness.md) and\n   [accountability](vocab/accountability.md) are going to be required at all levels\n   in any organization or ecosystem.\n2. Human Capital needs to be known, valued, leveraged and optimized.\n3. Data Capital needs to be known, valued, leveraged and optimized.\n4. Increasing competitiveness depends more and more on having the \n   highest quality and depth of data, information and knowledge.\n5. Having one \"censored\", biased, Single version of the Truth (SVOT)\n   is no longer good enough for many---if not most---use cases in \n   most domains.\n6. The world becomes more and more polarised due to \n   \"information bubbles\" that many people are not escaping\n   from, more depth, context and connectedness is needed. \n7. The world becomes more and more complex and harder to understand, \n   a holistic view around every given topic, showing all viewpoints,\n   would provide people---and AI's---with deeper understanding enabling\n   them to make better decisions.\n8. Reusability of deliverables, components, artefacts, data, information,\n   knowledge and logic needs to effectively be the highest priority since\n   it positively affects all of the above.\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"All Data Connected\"</p> <pre><code>1. All data that _can_ be connected, _will_ be connected.\n    * Information, Knowledge, Meaning, Logic: it's all data.\n    * Knowledge &amp; Meaning will be captured as _machine-readable executable \n      models_.\n    * All your connected data is an EKG.\n2. All data will be made available anywhere\u2014secured and within entitlement\n   limits\u2014at any time to any device, node or edge.\n    * We embrace the _Open World_ and deal with the realities of\n      _Multiple versions of the Truth_ (MVOT).\n         - PS: Open World does _not_ mean that all data is open to everyone\n    * Leveraging all processing power and storage capacity that is available at the edge\n    * Reducing energy consumption\n4. We combine the digital footprint of activities along with a \n   digital representation of information and knowledge, from which \n   an EKG emerges.\n6. An EKG is connections of Knowledge Graphs across an Enterprise,\n   an Ecosystem or beyond.&lt;br/&gt;\n   See [principle 3: Distributed](principle/03-distributed.md).\n7. We encourage the use and widespread proliferation of \n   EKG identifiers (see [principle 1: Identity](principle/01-identity.md))\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Standards\"</p> <pre><code>1. EKGs are based on standards and therefore interoperable across boundaries.\n2. There are many types of standards that an EKG needs to be able to deal with.\n3. Standards are described as machine-readable models\u2014i.e. ontologies\u2014that \n   EKG Platforms can execute, interpret or enforce.\n\nSee also [principle 10: Standards](principle/10-standards.md).\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Data Markets\"</p> <pre><code>1. Any data source will be turned into a data publisher---or supplier---of one or more s\n   self-describing datasets.\n    - Any data sink will be turned into a data consumer, consuming one or more datasets.\n3. Data suppliers and consumers will find each other via a data market using a \n   standard \"lingua franca\" for the data itself, its meaning, all its associated policies\n   and metadata and especially also its use cases as executable models.\n4. The data market manages the information supply chains between all the various suppliers and consumers.\n5. The global data market will consist of many other more specific data markets\n   e.g. per industry or per enterprise.\n6. An EKG is the combination of one or more data markets and the deployment of its use cases.\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Open World\"</p> <pre><code>1. For any given \"Thing\"---i.e. an object\u2014there may be many representations in many datasets.\n2. An object's representations may be different in shape, meaning, timeliness, relevance and\n   quality---i.e. any given representation of information about a given object may represent \n   a different version of the truth.\n3. All representations of any given object shall be linked via shared identifiers.\n    - Identifiers shall be meaningless, opaque, web-resolvable and universally unique.&lt;br/&gt;\n      See [principle 1](principle/01-identity.md).\n    - An object can have multiple identifiers.\n4. Any given object consists of 1 or more datapoints.\n5. A datapoint represents a logical property of a given object.\n    - The identifier for a datapoint is the identifier of the object it belongs to plus at least one\n      identifier of the axiom that describes its meaning (which is also an object).\n6. Datapoints---or datapoint-values for the same object---can exist in many datasets. \n    - with potentially multiple versions of the truth in terms of meaning,\n      timeliness, relevance and quality.\n7. Any representation for any given datapoint of any data source shall be \n   made available to any device, node or edge in the network within legal, \n   policy and entitlement limits in real-time.\n8. Every \"object\" or \"thing\" that is represented as data in whichever dataset anywhere, \n   shall have an identifier that is universally unique, permanent, meaningless\n   or opaque and therefore shareable, resolvable through the HTTP protocol.&lt;br/&gt;\n   See [principle 1](principle/01-identity.md).\n\nSee also [principle 4: Open World](principle/04-open-world.md).\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"Notes\"</p> <pre><code>Work in progress notes: that add more explanation to the above:\n\n1. Data will be considered explained when its usage has no misconceptions nor ambiguities.\n1. The word \u201cdata\u201d has a lot of different notions associated with it.\nWe have these statements above, like \u201call data is connected\u201d, \u201c\u2026data will be made available anywhere\u2026\u201d,\nwhich could reinforce a particular notion that data is something that \u201cexists\u201d all around us,\nlike a digital footprint of activities.\nOn top of these statements on \u201cdata\u201d, the EKG is introduced as a combination of one or more data markets,\nwhich could further reinforce that \"EKG is connected data\".\nIf that\u2019s the notion that the manifesto wants to declare, it may appeal strongly to some sections more than others,\nlike those dealing with consolidation, analysis, reporting, verification etc.\nIf the manifesto\u2019s intent is broader (here, I am very conscious of Carl\u2019s note that it should stay away\nfrom any hubris!) it would help if there is a way to declare that information and knowledge is also data.\nAnd it is when we combine the digital footprint of activities along with a digital representation of\ninformation and knowledge, that a Knowledge Graph emerges.\nAnd on top of that notion, an Enterprise Knowledge Graph is connections of Knowledge Graphs across an Enterprise.\nThe intent of the above is to appeal broadly to different sections of an Enterprise,\naccommodating different norms and notions (again referring to Carl\u2019s insightful comment on Norms and Notions)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"fair/","title":"Mapping to the FAIR principles","text":"<p>The FAIR principles are a popular set of principles used by many Knowledge Graph practitioners.</p> <p>=== \"F - Findable\"</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"grid cards\" markdown&gt;\n\n- __FAIR Definition__\n\n    - **F1** -- (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier\n    - **F2** -- Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)\n    - **F3** -- Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe\n    - **F4** -- (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource\n\n- __Differences__\n\n    EKG Principles are slightly more specific or prescriptive:\n\n    - Metadata (objects) and data (objects) can potentially have multiple identifiers (but at least one).\n    - Those identifiers do not necessarily be \"persistent\" as long as they are (always) resolvable (through HTTP).\n    - The EKG identifiers (EKG/IRIs) of data objects (but not necessarily metadata objects) should be\n      \"opaque\" as in \"meaningless\", (relatively) safe to be emailed around, stored in other platforms,\n      maximising \"proliferation\".\n    - FAIR principle **F3** would be phrased the other way around: the data described by metadata refers to it via\n      the metadata identifier (i.e. the predicate-IRI).\n    - FAIR principle **F4** slightly differs as well, the EKG Principles require metadata to be directly\n      resolvable (via HTTP) machine-readable definitions of the semantics in verifiable formal logic\n      (preferably OWL 2).\n &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"A - Accessible\"</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"grid cards\" markdown&gt;\n\n- __FAIR Definition__\n\n     Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed,\n     possibly including authentication and authorisation.\n\n     - **A1** -- (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol\n     - **A1.1** -- The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable\n     - **A1.2** -- The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary\n     - **A2** -- Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available\n\n- __Differences__\n\n     EKG Principles are slightly more specific or prescriptive:\n\n     - _\"using a standardized communications protocol\"_ would be explicitly the HTTP protocol\n       (or actually HTTPS/TLS) as a minimum requirement and in addition to that any other protocol, \n       standardized or not.\n     - _\"metadata are accessible\"_ would be more explicit for the EKG: \n       all metadata has to be accessible through IRIs that are always \"resolvable\" via the HTTP protocol.\n       In other words, make sure that all your _OWL 2_ ontologies or _RDF Schema (RDFS)_ \n       vocabularies are placed on highly available durable infrastructure that can always be accessed via HTTP.\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"I - Interoperable\"</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"grid cards\" markdown&gt;\n\n- __FAIR Definition__\n\n     The data usually need to be integrated with other data.\n     In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.\n\n     - **I1** -- (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.\n     - **I2** -- (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles\n     - **I3** -- (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data\n\n- __Differences__\n\n     EKG Principles are slightly more specific or prescriptive:\n\n     - In the EKG the metadata that describes meaning i.e. the semantics\n       (there are also many other types of metadata) that \n       _formal and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation_\n       has to be preferably _OWL 2_ or at least _RDF Schema (RDFS)_ or _SHACL_.\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"R - Reusable\"</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"grid cards\" markdown&gt;\n\n- __FAIR Definition__\n\n    The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data.\n    To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or\n    combined in different settings.\n\n    - **R1** -- Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes\n    - **R1.1** -- (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license\n    - **R1.2** -- (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance\n    - **R1.3** -- (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards\n\n    The principles refer to three types of entities: data (or any digital object),\n    metadata (information about that digital object), and infrastructure.\n    For instance, principle F4 defines that both metadata and data are registered or indexed in a\n    searchable resource (the infrastructure component).\n\n- __Differences__\n\n    EKG Principles are slightly more specific or prescriptive:\n\n    - _optimization of the reuse of data is the ultimate goal_. \n      It's an important goal for EKG as well but reuse of knowledge and whole\n      use cases---with everything that comes with it---is an even higher level goal.\n      Furthermore, overall connectedness of all data and knowledge is an equally important goal.\n    - _metadata and data should be well-described_ but should also be as \"unbiased\" as possible, not designed\n      for one particular (set of) use case(s) but designed to represent the version of the truth that a given data\n      source provides with the highest level of integrity.&lt;br/&gt;\n      See principle [5 -- Self-describing](../principle/05-self-describing.md).\n    - _Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes_.\n      \"_Richly described_\" would not be specific enough for EKG.\n      It would have to be _directly resolvable to a machine-readable definition in verifiable formal logic_.\n    - For all types of recognized metadata, which is metadata that services of the various EKG platforms can\n      recognize, the EKGF will specify accepted standards or define standards itself or in\n      collaboration with partners like the OMG.\n      Since an EKG is a collection of self-describing datasets, each dataset will have its \n      various types of metadata organized in a structured way.\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"other/","title":"Other","text":"<p>The Enterprise Knowledge Graph Foundation is working on multiple initiatives that have lead to various websites:</p>"},{"location":"other/#ekgforg","title":"ekgf.org","text":"<p>The main website of the Foundation: https://ekgf.org</p>"},{"location":"other/#principles","title":"Principles","text":"<p>The EKG/Principles:  https://principles.ekgf.org,  this is a project that is being maintained in the GitHub repository  EKGF/principles.</p> <p>You're welcome to contribute.</p>"},{"location":"other/#maturity-model","title":"Maturity Model","text":"<p>The Maturity Model for the Enterprise Knowledge Graph:  https://maturity.ekgf.org, this is a project that is being maintained in the GitHub repository  EKGF/ekg-mm.</p> <p>You're welcome to contribute.</p>"},{"location":"other/#catalog","title":"Catalog","text":"<p>All use cases from the community, their datasets and their ontologies: https://catalog.ekgf.org</p>"},{"location":"other/#use-case-tree-method","title":"Use Case Tree Method","text":"<p>A proposal for a front-to-back method to support your EKG journey: https://method.ekgf.org, this is a project that is being maintained in the GitHub repository EKGF/ekg-method.</p> <p>You're welcome to contribute.</p>"},{"location":"principle/","title":"EKG Principles","text":"<p>=== \"Intro\"</p> <pre><code>These principles are intended to provide guidelines for the development and deployment\nof an [_Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG)_](../vocab/ekg.md).\n\nThe principles emphasize shared meaning and content reuse that are the cornerstone\nof operating in complex and interconnected environments.\n\nAn enterprise that complies with all ten principles has an Enterprise Knowledge Graph.\n</code></pre> <p>=== \"10 Principles\"</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"grid cards\" markdown&gt;\n\n- :material-cached:{ .lg } __1 -
