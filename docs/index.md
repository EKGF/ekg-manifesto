# Manifesto

## Ideals

1. Much higher levels of transparency, sustainability, fairness and
accountability are going to be required at all levels in any organization
2. Human Capital needs to be known, valued, leveraged and optimized
3. Data Capital needs to be known, valued, leveraged and optimized
4. Increasing competitiveness depends more and more on having the 
   highest quality and depth of data, information and knowledge
5. One "censored", biased, Single version of the Truth (SVOT)
   is no longer good enough for many--if not most--use cases in 
   most domains
6. The world becomes more and more polarised due to 
   "information bubbles" that many people are not escaping
   from, more depth and connectedness is needed 
7. The world becomes more and more complex and harder to understand, 
   a holistic view around every given topic, showing all viewpoints,
   would help people to understand and make better decisions

## All Data Connected

1. All data will be connected.
   * Information, Knowledge, Meaning: it's all data.
   * Knowledge & Meaning will be captured as _machine-readable executable 
     models_.
2. All data will be made available anywhere--within entitlement
   limits--at any time to any device, node or edge.
   * We embrace the _Open World_[^1] and deal with the realities of
     _Multiple versions of the Truth_ (MVOT).
4. We combine the digital footprint of activities along with a 
   digital representation of information and knowledge, from which 
   an EKG emerges.
5. All your connected data is an EKG.
6. An EKG is connections of Knowledge Graphs across an Enterprise,
   an Eco-system or beyond.
7. We encourage the use and widespread proliferation of 
   EKG identifiers

[^1]: Does not mean all data is open to everyone
