# Control

<!--summary-start-->
Entitlement, privacy and business policies will be modeled in the EKG
and automatically executed, enforced and audited at the Data Point level.
<!--summary-end-->

The EKG can use enterprise and organization knowledge to express 
access not only in terms of access control lists, but in terms of 
business rules, policies, logic and information content. 

### Rationale

Use of the EKG itself to control and enforce access allows 
more power and conciseness of policy expression and execution 
while linking to existing enterprise directories.

### Implications

Appropriate enterprise directories should be integrated in the EKG.
It can take some thought to design what the policies should be at 
the business level.
