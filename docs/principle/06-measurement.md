<!--summary-end-->

Quality comprises multiple dimensions including _accuracy_, _timeliness_, _completeness_, _relevance_, 
_conformity_, _integrity_. 
EKG technology allows greater power and flexibility for expressing quality rules and metrics, 
but existing data quality tooling could also be used.
