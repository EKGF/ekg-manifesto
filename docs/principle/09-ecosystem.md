# Ecosystem

An enterprise will use a heterogeneous set of technologies and data sources which
will be incorporated into the EKG over time. 
All data entering the ecosystem are subject to service level agreements.

A true EKG is a federation of multiple data-sources and systems 
both within and external to the enterprise; seamlessly knitted together with 
standard protocols and APIs.
An EKG needs to be managed and evolved as a fairly complex system of systems. 
To provide the flexibility and agility needed, its management needs to be automated, 
and linked to development processes, through the discipline of _data operations_.

### Rationale

As an ecosystem, an EKG can non-disruptively evolve over time in technology, 
scalability and information and business needs addressed.

### Implications

The management of the EKG needs to be planned for and resourced.
It's important to coordinate with the owners of existing systems being used 
to provide capability under the EKG umbrella.
