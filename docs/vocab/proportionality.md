# Proportionality

Quote from the document ["European Interoperability Framework, underlying Principles of European Public Services"](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf):

!!! note ""

     The proportionality principle limits EU actions to what is necessary to achieve the objectives
     of the Treaties.

Proportionality is also a principle concerning Enterprise Knowledge Graphs since what goes for the EU as a whole
also goes for an enterprise or any other organization at a smaller scale:

!!! note ""

     The proportionality principle limits the enterprise's actions to what is
     necessary to achieve the interoperability requirements that support the
     strategic objectives of the enterprise.

In other words, give as much autonomy to each department or line of business,
keep every enterprise level operation "proportional".
