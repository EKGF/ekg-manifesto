# Subsidiarity

Quote from the document ["European Interoperability Framework, underlying Principles of European Public Services"](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf):

!!! note ""
     
     The subsidiarity principle requires EU decisions to be taken as closely as possible
     to  the  citizen.  In  other  words,  the  EU  does  not  take  action  unless  this  is  more  
     effective  than  the  same  action  taken  at  national  level.
