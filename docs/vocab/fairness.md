TODO. Notes:

- Link to FAIR data principles.
- Fairness in the workplace contributes to employees feeling 
  safe and engaged in the work they produce. 
  It creates a productive environment for employees in which
  the organization compensates them fairly and management 
  professionals equally appreciate each employee's hard work.[^indeed-career]
